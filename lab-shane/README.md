# Lab 22 Crud Controller

This project makes Ajax requests to a server to create a simple resource.  A list can be created by inserting a name and clicking on the 'Create' button.  A list can be deleted by id number (which can be found in the console after creating a list).  Finally all lists on the database can be printed by clicking the 'Get All Lists' button.
